**Description**
DartExcelUtils is a Dart-based toolkit developed to efficiently merge, edit, and manage Excel files. This tool is specifically designed for handling and reorganizing data related to passive electronic components, such as capacitors and resistors, sourced from Digi-Key. It automates the process of organizing data, making it ideal for use in Altium database libraries.

**Features**
 - Merge and Edit Excel Files: Combine multiple Excel files into a
   single cohesive dataset.
 - Data Management: Organize and streamline
 - data Automated Sorting: Automatically arrange data in a desired order (e.g., resistor values in ascending order).
 - Tailored for Altium: Optimized for managing data within the Altium
   ecosystem, ensuring compatibility and ease of use.

**Use Case**
Managing and reorganizing the extensive data collected on passive electronic components can be a daunting task when done manually. This project was created to automate and simplify this process. The data, sourced from Digi-Key and initially in Excel format, includes detailed information such as manufacturer part numbers, manufacturers, datasheet links, and tolerances. The DartExcelUtils ensures that all this data is systematically organized and easily accessible, making it perfect for integration into Altium database libraries.
